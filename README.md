# Robust_ECN
â€‹ Implementation  of Robust ECN Signaling with Nonces in ns-3

The ECN-nonce is a simple, efficient mechanism to eliminate the potential abuse of ECN. It uses the two ECN-Capable Transport (ECT) codepoints in the ECN field of the IP header, and requires a flag in the TCP header. It is computationally efficient for both routers and hosts.
